## Essay Questions 
___
### 1. Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.  
>
#### I want to join Ada Developers Academy for three reasons:  
> *	**Mission and Values**: Ada is more than a software development training program. It is a social impact organization that understands that diversity in technology is a social justice emergency remedied by advocating inclusivity, lifelong learning, and supportive communities. 
> *	**Curriculum**: I love to learn complex concepts. The Ada curriculum is challenging, flexible, and adaptable. Participants are trained in multiple programing language competencies. Students are taught ‘the how’ of software development. This skill set will serve me well in the future by decreasing the learning curve when being introduced to foreign coding languages.  
> *	**Learning Environment**:  Being a part of a cohort of women and gender diverse persons is comforting; it creates a safe space, as well as, a positive, collaborative and supportive environment for learning.  
>
#### I love the creative aspect of programming. Thus far, my exposure to technology/programming has been through:
> *	**Social Entrepreneurship**: Founder of a non-profit (Teen V.O.I.C.E. Inc) that teaches minority teens the logic and sequencing of programming, the science of innovation, and 3D printing/prototyping. 
> *	**Courses**: Completed an introductory HTML and CSS course on Codeacademy.com and took an introduction to Computer Science course in college that I enjoyed. 
> *	**Support Group**: Friends and mentors who are coders and/or work in the IT field. 
> *	**Internships**: Interned with technology startups, worked in the marketing function as a project manager using scrum and agile methodologies. 
> *	**Volunteerism**: Volunteered at Sandlapper Elementary (SC) and IT-ology (SC) teaching digital literacy and igniting youths’ passion for STEM. 
>

### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field? 
>
> My passion is software development and disruptive technologies for the growing enterprise. I want to launch a career as a developer in the blockchain space and consult companies across diverse industry sectors on how to leverage distributed ledger systems for optimal business performance.
>
> The first two to three years will be spent on the software development side working on different projects, perfecting multiple programing languages, and building expertise in at least one blockchain stack. In year four, I will solidify my expertise by leading and contributing to blockchain research and development projects. By the end of year five, I will transition into solutions architecture so that I can work with key enterprise decision makers and advise/consult them on the business value of blockchain technical solutions.
>
> Ada will provide foundational technical skills. I currently hold an MBA. I am testing for the Project Management Professionals certification in May 2018. My MBA and PMP coupled with the technical and developer skills obtained through Ada will transform me into a three-dimensional tech professional: one who can contribute to and manage software development teams/projects; lead product research/ development divisions; consultant in the disruptive technology space; and eventually join the C-suite as a technology executive. My ultimate goal is to be a Chief Technology Innovation Officer for a Fortune 100 company.  
>
> I will continue to impact the technology industry through my community activism and social entrepreneurial endeavors by working with minority youth, exposing them to technology, and encouraging them to pursue STEM careers. 
>
>
### 3. Read Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  
> 
#### By being present. 
> Working as a software developer, effectively contributing to projects; participating in networking events, speaking at professional conferences, joining boards or being an advisor to entities that promote diversity in tech, and taking on leadership roles in the company I work for. Most importantly, I will establish presence by creating voice in all of the aforementioned spaces. 
>
#### By extending a ladder to others.  
> I believe to whom much is given, much is expected. As an Ada alum, I will volunteer with Ada as a mentor to or teaching assistant for future cohorts.  
>
#### By implementing change.
> I will continue my community activism and social entrepreneurial work to facilitate gender, ethnic, economic, and disability inclusivity in the tech industry by: 
* Continuing to host 4-day innovation science/ STEM summer camps for teens.
* Institute an intensive-coding camp and internship program for high school students who are underrepresented in the tech industry. 
* Deploy STEM supplemental education/ after school programs in local inner-city schools using project based teaching methodologies.

### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently? 
>
> My first quarter of my MBA program, I struggled miserably. I made the mistake of not asking for help. I matriculated in to the MBA program with minimum qualitative analysis skills and little to none business acumen. Plus, the curriculum was accelerated so I struggled with keeping up.  Sadly, my pride would not allow me to admit to others that I was struggling. 
>
> To overturn my mistake, I did three things. First, I reached out to my instructor. I inquired about additional resources that would help my grasping the material. Second, I built rapport with the teaching assistant: asking questions, attending help sessions, and increasing productivity by doing the homework in advance. 
>
> I also identified my learning style. I am a visual and kinesthetic learner. I learn best by displaying concept relationships with a diagram or map, and by practicing, doing, or simulations. 
>
> Lastly and most importantly, I reached out to others in my cohort. I organized help sessions and joined study groups. I discovered others in my cohort were having challenges as well. Through our shared experience, we bonded and built community. 
>
> One of the lessons I took from my MBA experience is the importance of communication, transparency, and collaboration. It is okay to admit you do not know how to do something.  It is okay to ask for help. The key is to fail fast and to be proactive. If I had to redo my first quarter, I would immediately execute the aforementioned.
