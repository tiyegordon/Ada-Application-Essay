## Essay Questions 
___
### 1. Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.  
>
> I want to join Ada Developers Academy for three reasons:  
>> *	**Mission and Values**: Ada is more than a software development training program. It is a social impact organization that understands that diversity in technology is a social justice emergency remedied by advocating inclusivity, lifelong learning, and supportive communities. 
>> *	**Curriculum**: I love to learn complex concepts. The Ada curriculum is challenging, flexible, and adaptable. Participants are trained in multiple programing language competencies. Students are taught ‘the how’ of software development. This skill set will serve me well in the future by decreasing the learning curve when being introduced to foreign coding languages.  
>> *	**Learning Environment**:  Being a part of a cohort of women and gender diverse persons is comforting; it creates a safe space, as well as, a positive, collaborative and supportive environment for learning.  
>
>Thus far, my exposure to technology has been through:
>> *	**Social Entrepreneurship**: Founder of a non-profit (Teen V.O.I.C.E. Inc) that teaches minority teens the logic and sequencing of programming, the science of innovation, and 3D printing/prototyping. 
>> *	**Courses**: Completed an introductory HTML and CSS course on Codeacademy.com and took an introduction to Computer Science course in college that I enjoyed. 
>> *	**Support Group**: Friends and mentors who are coders and/or work in the IT field. 
>> *	**Internships**: Interned with technology startups, worked in the marketing function as a project manager using scrum and agile methodologies. 
>> *	**Volunteerism**: Volunteered at Sandlapper Elementary (SC) and IT-ology (SC) teaching digital literacy and igniting youths’ passion for STEM.
